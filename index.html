              <p class="card-text">There are many people that have actually checked out publications as well as seen their sales rise. However, there are also numerous others who have reviewed publications however have not sold any type of copies. If you are just one of those people, it may be time to transform your strategy for publication advertising. If you are simply beginning with your book, then you should probably stick with typical approaches. The reason for this is that a lot of these traditional methods are still working. For example, if you are utilizing article advertising and marketing, you will certainly see a boost in web traffic to your web site. This traffic will certainly lead to even more sales if you write short articles that include a link back to your web site. This is an easy method to market your book. Nonetheless, if you intend to take things to the following level, you can utilize social media. There are several websites that enable you to get in touch with various other authors.

              <p class="card-text">Let&rsquo;s look at some of the most popular promotion services: paid reviews: $425 for services like kirkus, but there is no guarantee you will receive a positive review. Facebook ads: $500 print media: $1000 professional marketing services: $2000 if you&rsquo;re stomach has clenched, you&rsquo;re not alone. A minimal book promotion budget can easily run $4000 or more. 
 When added to the book production costs, the total budget can easily exceed $7500. Unfortunately, with the current available book promotion avenues, you will have to pay to for the exposure. Frankly, with the exception of the kindle kdp select program, free giveaways and other efforts to promote your book without incurring any expense are unlikely to work. 
 My books have been published at amazon, barnes &amp; noble, audible and apple itunes. I was in more sellers earlier but decided exclusivity with amazon, on my published works was best for them. My books , ebooks and audiobooks on christianity are my most important published works. I also like pointing people to my books on the invention marketing subject or for also giving signed copies away to them. The ones i once did have a small supply of, i gave away to a few people who had invention &ndash; new product ideas. But again, my preference is to give away my christian subject-matter works. 
 While these programs are good for readers, they may not always be the most beneficial for authors,</p>

              <p class="card-text">The original amazon kindle was released on november 19, 2007, and sold out in five and a half hours in spite of the $399 price tag. With many people adding themselves to the waiting list, the kindle did not come back in stock until the end of april 2008. Aside from its e-ink screen, selling features included the ability to download books from amazon from anywhere with the included 3g access; indeed, once the kindle was purchased and linked to an amazon account, there was no need to have a computer to load new content. Although the first generation could only hold a few hundred books in memory, it also contained an sd card slot to hold extra books, as well as the ability to delete books and then re-download them from amazon at no extra charge. 
 As you might know by now, writers have several different self-publishing platforms to choose from. I chose to go through amazon kindle direct publishing (kdp). For me, it was a simple choice. Kdp (which was known as createspace back when i published my book) was one of the more established platforms, with countless reviews from other authors verifying how seamless the process was and even outlining step-by-step directions for publishing. I liked that publishing through kdp meant my book would automatically be available through amazon&rsquo;s kindle unlimited program, and since selling through amazon was a priority of mine, publishing through their platform</p>
