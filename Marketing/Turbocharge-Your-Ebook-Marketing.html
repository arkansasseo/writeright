		  <p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the most popular promotion services: paid reviews: $425 for services like kirkus, but there is no guarantee you will receive a positive review. Facebook ads: $500 print media: $1000 professional marketing services: $2000 if you&rsquo;re stomach has clenched, you&rsquo;re not alone. A minimal book promotion budget can easily run $4000 or more.</p>
<p>When added to the book production costs, the total budget can easily exceed $7500. Unfortunately, with the current available book promotion avenues, you will have to pay to for the exposure. Frankly, with the exception of the kindle kdp select program, free giveaways and other efforts to promote your book without incurring any expense are unlikely to work.</p>
<p>My books have been published at amazon, barnes &amp; noble, audible and apple itunes. I was in more sellers earlier but decided exclusivity with amazon, on my published works was best for them. My books , ebooks and audiobooks on christianity are my most important published works. I also like pointing people to my books on the invention marketing subject or for also giving signed copies away to them. The ones i once did have a small supply of, i gave away to a few people who had invention &ndash; new product ideas. But again, my preference is to give away my christian subject-matter works.</p>
<p>While these programs are good for readers, they may not always be the most beneficial for authors, except in that they expand the reading (not necessarily buying) audience for your work. This is not to discourage you from publishing on kdp or amazon! they are the leading publishing players in today&rsquo;s marketplace. Rather, now that you understand how these programs can impact you, you can make more informed decisions on your investments in self publishing and marketing your kindle ebooks.</p>
<h2>The Self-Publishing Path: It&rsquo;s Often Anything But &ldquo;Self&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the self-publishing industry, amazon and other indie publishing platforms have made it progressively easier for authors to get their work onto the market.</p>
<p>Yes, there are still caveats. And self-publishing isn&rsquo;t for everyone. Knowing the pros and cons of self-publishing makes it easier to decide whether this is the right path for you to take with your book.</p>
<p>You may find that authoring online articles is a better path. I learned an important lesson from my own experience&mdash;a book cannot be changed once it&rsquo;s published, but online articles can be updated and improved as you see fit over time. I find that to be a better choice over book publishing. But once you have a portfolio of online articles, you can choose to create a book from your content if that is your decision.</p>
<h3>Self-Publishing with a Company</h3>
<p>The process behind selecting the right printing company was rather difficult considering that most printers don&rsquo;t offer enough high quality printing options. Publishing xpress offered the products and services we needed to complete our project without compromising on the design. Our experience was smooth and effortless. The ordering process took only five minutes and before we knew it, our order had been shipped. Continue reading &raquo;.</p>
<p>When i was in the promotional products industry, there were suppliers who offered customized playing card decks that were simply the regular 52-card playing card deck with the backs imprinted with a logo to promote a company's brand. But that's not what we're talking about here. A custom-printed card deck in the publishing and self-publishing arenas is a deck of custom printed cards that serves to provide information, inspiration, education, or entertainment. True, it might even provide a game as a standard card deck might, but that is not required.</p>
<p>By abi d. Marketing &ldquo;the savage soul &ndash; a book for the warfare of life&rdquo; is a unique motivational book where the readers can learn about many life lessons. And now, it is available on kickstarter. People are more powerful than they can imagine. They just need &nbsp;to understand it more. This is a message that is delivered by a new book entitled &ldquo;the savage soul &ndash; a book for the warfare of life&rdquo;. The book was authorized by tss and the new publishing start-up company innovative authors group llc. The company is taking a very unique and aggressive set of tactics to disrupt the publishing industry.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of wannabe authors out there in the world. Many of them are niaive of the vulture ridden business world of publishing. No company, no con-scheme could survive all these years on the measely proceeds of brokering four actual contracts (for foreign writers who found publishers on their own and wanted an agent to negotiate on their behalf &ndash; and stumbled upon robert fletcher. ) no, but consider their widespread.</p>
<h2>How to self-publish your book on Amazon Kindle Direct (KDP)</h2>
<p>One of the tactics that i like better than a book launch team is offering the new book at a deep discount after it publishes. This can cost effectively be done with either a very limited time free ebook promotion or kindle countdown deal if you use kindle direct publishing (kdp) to publish your ebook and you enroll the title in kdp select. If people are really interested in your book, they will wander over to take advantage of the offer and create verified purchase review possibilities.</p>
<p>Kdp is one of the publishing tools on amazon that helps the authors to use to publish their books online. Kdp helps an online book available on amazon to kindle readers.

<p>A great question came up from one of my blog readers about unpublishing previous editions of a fiction book series in order to rewrite and republish them. Because positive reviews for the original book series had been received, there was a concern about losing those reviews with new editions. There are a number of considerations for rewriting and republishing. What follows applies to self-published books on kindle direct publishing (kdp) and acx/audible.</p>
