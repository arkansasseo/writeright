		  <p>The original amazon kindle was released on november 19, 2007, and sold out in five and a half hours in spite of the $399 price tag. With many people adding themselves to the waiting list, the kindle did not come back in stock until the end of april 2008. Aside from its e-ink screen, selling features included the ability to download books from amazon from anywhere with the included 3g access; indeed, once the kindle was purchased and linked to an amazon account, there was no need to have a computer to load new content. Although the first generation could only hold a few hundred books in memory, it also contained an sd card slot to hold extra books, as well as the ability to delete books and then re-download them from amazon at no extra charge. <img style="max-width: 60%; margin: 3px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1572017208060-abf082c31f55?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MXx8c2VsZi1wdWJsaXNoaW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxNjQ0MDc1OA\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="self+publishing" align="right" /></p>
<p>As you might know by now, writers have several different self-publishing platforms to choose from. I chose to go through amazon kindle direct publishing (kdp). For me, it was a simple choice. Kdp (which was known as createspace back when i published my book) was one of the more established platforms, with countless reviews from other authors verifying how seamless the process was and even outlining step-by-step directions for publishing. I liked that publishing through kdp meant my book would automatically be available through amazon&rsquo;s kindle unlimited program, and since selling through amazon was a priority of mine, publishing through their platform made the most sense.</p>
<p>Barely a week goes by where i don&rsquo;t see some &ldquo;i won&rsquo;t work with amazon&rdquo; outburst from a self published author on social media. Here's a recent example. This author was completing an audio book. He didn&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;throw up his hands&rdquo; like other authors and publishers and &ldquo;give&rdquo; his book to audible. So he was looking for advice on hosting and selling it through his website, even though the audio book file was hundreds of megabytes and many hours of listen time in an apple itunes media format.</p>
<p>Self-publishing school is an online self-publishing education company founded by chandler bolt after he discovered how lucrative self-publishing a book really is. Once others realized he was consistently making 4 figures in passive income per month from his bestselling books, they wanted to know one thing: how?! this is where self-publishing school was born. Today, this self-publishing company has helped over 5,000 students from more than 65 countries self-publish their books to bestseller status with programs offering 1-on-1 coaching, full education material from the process of starting your book, to a marketing plan, to a step-by-step guide to self-publish your book on amazon with inside tips to earn that coveted best seller banner.</p>
<h2>Ebook writers: Can you tell me exactly what you do?</h2>
<p>From mizb: &ldquo;hi, bill, i have a question for a future edition of your mailbag: &ldquo;recently my articles have been attracting attention with some invitations from other writers and companies. There's one invitation that i intend to accept because it pays well and may be an opening for future opportunities. <img style="max-width: 30%; margin: 4px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506126613408-eca07ce68773?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MTV8fHNlbGYtcHVibGlzaGluZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MTY0NDA3NTk\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="books" align="left" /> But that's not what i'm writing about. &ldquo;i've been solicited to do a book review on a book published by mt publishing. They say the publisher can send me a hard copy or give me a link to the ebook. I looked up the book and it is quite pricy around ($40), so the author must have put some work or money, or both, into it.</p>
<p>Facebook says it wants to &ldquo;empower&rdquo; independent writers and journalists by letting them make money from their work. The social giant on tuesday confirmed plans to launch a new platform for writers to self-publish their content, grow their audience and make money through monetization tools starting with subscriptions. Facebook said the platform will roll out in the coming months in the u. S.</p>
<p>March 16, 2021 3:26 pm et facebook inc. Is rolling out new self-publishing tools it says will help writers and other cultural producers reach audiences and get paid for their work, the latest example of a social-media company pushing to keep creators in its fold. Facebook said tuesday it plans to offer a free, customizable publishing tool that allows users to develop websites and email newsletters as well as charge for subscriptions. Among other features, creators will be able to monitor how their content is resonating with readers and build audiences through facebook groups, the company said.</p>
<p>I so adamantly believe that knowing how to conduct a ghostwriting interview is a bedrock of success that i wrote a book about it. And even better yet, i&rsquo;m giving that ebook away for free to anyone. While this book doesn&rsquo;t necessarily cover the topic of writers conferences as this blog does, it does serve as a primer for a professional mentality with your writing. I can&rsquo;t think of a better frame of mind to be in during a conference than, i&rsquo;m a professional, i know what i&rsquo;m doing here.</p>
